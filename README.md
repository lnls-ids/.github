# üåü LNLS Insertion Devices and Photon Diagnostic Group (IDS)

Welcome to the GitHub organization for the **IDS Group** at the **Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS)**.  

The **Insertion Devices and Photon Diagnostic Group (IDS)** is dedicated to defining optimal light sources for the beamlines of the **Sirius synchrotron**, as well as developing and operating diagnostic components that utilize synchrotron radiation. Our work directly supports cutting-edge scientific research and innovation. üöÄ

## üéØ **Our Mission**
The IDS group is responsible for:  
1. **Light Sources for Beamlines**  
   - Optimizing the parameters of insertion devices to tailor light properties for each beamline.  
   - Minimizing the impact of these devices on the storage ring's performance.  
   - Collaborating closely with scientific teams, engineering groups, and accelerator specialists.  

2. **Diagnostics for the Accelerator**  
   - Developing and operating the **Carcar√° beamline**, which uses synchrotron radiation to monitor and diagnose the electron beam in the storage ring.
